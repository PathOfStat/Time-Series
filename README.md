# Time-Series
in this file we are going to learn how to do time series analysis using R
I am using three books as my main reference when creating this that is : <br />
1. Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods, 2nd edition, 2006 <br />
2. Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R <br />
3. Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed) Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos <br />
